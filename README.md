# JearBot
## A discord bot with custom functionality

This discord bot is named after my online nickname "JearStar" and has features tailored to my needs in some of the
 discord servers that I am a part of. The bot has some features such as saying hello, making random teams for custom
  games, and retrieving basic League of Legends information of a player using Riot's API. This discord bot uses the
   Java Discord API: https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA
   
   Because my IDE needs to be constantly running for the bot to remain online and functioning, it has been inactive
    as I would have to pay money for the bot to be hosted and kept online 24/7.
